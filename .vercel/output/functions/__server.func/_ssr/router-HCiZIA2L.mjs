		body: "Texas H.B. 1181 requires certain commercial sites that publish sexually explicit material obscene to minors to verify that visitors are 18 or older. The Fifth Circuit had applied rational-basis review. The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Thomas, held that the law only incidentally burdens adults' protected speech, is subject to intermediate scrutiny, and survives that review. Adults, the Court said, have no First Amendment right to access such speech without first submitting proof of age.\n\nJustice Kagan dissented, joined by Justices Sotomayor and Jackson. The decision effectively opened the door to similar statutes nationwide and is the reason many aggregators geo-fence or age-gate whole U.S. states. It sits in tension with older cases that applied strict scrutiny to similar burdens (including a 2004 decision the majority declined to follow).\n\nNot legal advice.
